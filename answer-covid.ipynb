      "What is coronavirus and what is COVID-19? \n",
      "There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly \n",
      "cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease caused by \n",
      "a new coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.   \n",
      " \n",
      "How do people become infected and how does it spread? \n",
      "Current understanding about how the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads is \n",
      "largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. COVID-19 is a new \n",
      "disease and there is more to learn about how it spreads, the severity of illness it \n",
      "causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.  \n",
      " \n",
      "What are the symptoms of COVID-19? \n",
      "People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of reported symptoms – ranging \n",
      "from mild symptoms to severe illness.  \n",
      " \n",
      "What if I am sick with COVID-19? \n",
      "If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and \n",
      "symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your \n",
      "healthcare provider immediately. To help prevent the disease from spreading to \n",
      "people in your home and community, follow these CDC recommendations. \n",

      "benefits to see a doctor to receive health guidance related to COVID-19 without \n",
      "leaving home using your smart phone, tablet or computer-enabled web cam. \n",
      " \n",
      "How can I help protect myself?  \n",
      "The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus that \n",
      "causes COVID-19.  \n",
      "Avoid close contact \n",
      "  Avoid close contact with people who are sick \n",

      "higher risk of getting very sick. \n",
      "  Practice good health habits. Everyday preventive actions help to prevent \n",
      "the spread of respiratory viruses. \n",
      "o  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \n",
      "especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after \n",
      "blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. \n",
      "o  If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand \n",
      "sanitizer  with  at  least  60  percent  alcohol.  Always  wash  hands  with \n",
      "soap and water if hands are visibly dirty. \n",
      "o  Avoid close contact with people who are sick. \n",
      "o  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. \n",
      "o  Stay home when you are sick. \n",
      "o  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in \n",
      "the trash. \n",
      "o  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a \n",
      "regular household cleaning spray or wipe.  \n",

      "Do I need to wear a face cloth cover?  \n",
      "It’s best to follow the CDC’s recommendations on how to protect yourself, \n",

      "  On May 1, 2020, the Food & Drug Administration issued an Emergency Use \n",
      "Authorization (EUA) for the antiviral drug remdesivir. While this EUA does \n",

      "Patients provide test samples in the doctor’s office, emergency room or hospital. \n",
      "Some areas may also have drive-through COVID-19 testing sites. There, swabs \n",
      "from patients’ nose, (and possibly mucus for those with a cough), will be collected \n",
      "and sent to a special lab to test for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-\n",
