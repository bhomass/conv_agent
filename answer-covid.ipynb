      "What is coronavirus and what is COVID-19? \n",
      "There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly \n",
      "cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease caused by \n",
      "a new coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.   \n",
      " \n",
      "How do people become infected and how does it spread? \n",
      "Current understanding about how the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads is \n",
      "largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. COVID-19 is a new \n",
      "disease and there is more to learn about how it spreads, the severity of illness it \n",
      "causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.  \n",
      " \n",
      "What are the symptoms of COVID-19? \n",
      "People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of reported symptoms – ranging \n",

      " \n",
      "What if I am sick with COVID-19? \n",
      "If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and \n",
      "symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your \n",

      "leaving home using your smart phone, tablet or computer-enabled web cam. \n",
      " \n",
      "How can I help protect myself?  \n",
      "The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus that \n",

      "Avoid close contact \n",
      "  Avoid close contact with people who are sick \n",

      "o  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, \n",
      "especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after \n",

      "o  If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand \n",

      "generally speaking, not impacted.  \n",
      "  At Walgreens locations with a 24-hour pharmacy, the pharmacy drive-thru \n",
      "will remain open 24 hours to assist customers and patients with their \n",

      "emergency, including relaxing early refill limits for medications. \n",
      "26 | P a g e  \n",

      "who wish to refill a prescription earlier than is indicated based on the day \n",
      "supply they have previously received. \n",

      "members to consider filling a 90-day supply of maintenance medications, \n",
      "where appropriate, to ensure that they have a sufficient supply of \n",
      "medications that are taken regularly on hand.  \n",
      "  Consistent with CDC recommendations, and to avoid unjustified pressure \n",
      "on the pharmacy supply chain, we have advised members against \n",
      "“stockpiling” medication unnecessarily and will continue to support policies \n",
      "that allow members to obtain their medications in a safe and effective \n",

      " \n",
      "If a member recently filled their prescription, will IngenioRx allow an early refill \n",
      "of the prescription? \n",
      "  Yes. For members who are worried about having enough of their prescribed \n",

      "that we will allow members to refill their prescription early through an \n",
      "emergency refill at their local pharmacy. The pharmacist will be able to \n",

      "Yes. Members will be able to refill early and get a 30-day supply if they are \n",
      "concerned about having enough medication on hand. \n",
      " \n",
      "Isn’t this change promoting stockpiling of drugs?  \n",
      "  We continue to reinforce the guidance, as supported by CDC \n",
      "recommendations, that individuals should not stockpile prescription \n",
      "medications.  \n",
      "  That said, we believe that it is critically important that individuals continue \n",
      "to take their medications as prescribed by their doctor. We will continue to \n",
      "take steps to support our members in their efforts to do so in a manner \n",
      "that is safe and effective. \n",
      "  We believe that this policy, particularly in light of the President’s \n",
      "emergency declaration, is consistent with that approach and we will \n",
      "monitor utilization patterns to identify any refill behavior that seems \n",
      "irregular. \n",
      " \n",
      "Can a client opt out of this? \n",
      "No. Due to the complexities associated with allowing individual employer groups \n",

      "\f",
      "Will the early refill policy increase cost? Who will cover the cost associated with \n",
      "the additional refills? \n",
      "  While this could increase costs in the short run as a result of people filling \n",
      "prescriptions earlier than anticipated, it is our hope that these costs will be \n",
      "offset by a member not needing to fill a prescription down the road. \n",
      "  [Fully insured customers] Members will still be responsible for their normal \n",
      "cost share and Empire will cover the plan costs associated with any \n",
      "prescription refills. \n",
      "  [ASO customers] Members will still be responsible for their normal cost \n",

      "As a result of COVID-19, the Drug Enforcement Agency is now allowing \n",
      "telemedicine providers to issue prescriptions for controlled substances. What \n",
      "controls does Empire have in place to prevent abuse? \n",
      "  On March 16th, the DEA, in coordination with the Secretary of Health & \n",
      "Human Services, announced that it was temporarily waiving the in-person \n",
      "exam restrictions on the prescribing of controlled substances (schedule II-V) \n",
      "via telemedicine. \n",
      "  Empire, and its PBM IngenioRx, will follow the directives from HHS and the \n",
      "DEA, as well as any superseding local regulations, related to this issue. \n",
      "  Empire was an early leader in the area of implementing pharmacy controls \n",
      "to prevent the misuse and abuse of controlled substances such as opioids \n",
      "and, as a result of our actions, we have reduced opioid utilization among \n",
      "our membership by more than 50 percent since 2015. \n",
      "  These controls include limiting initial prescriptions for short-acting opioids \n",
      "to no more than a seven-day supply, prior authorization requirements for \n",
      "all long acting opioids and short-acting opioids exceeding a fourteen day \n",

      "substances, prior authorizations on stimulants such as ADHD drugs, and \n",
      "more.   \n",
      "  Given the significant positive impact that these, and other controls, have \n",
      "had on managing the use of controlled substances we do not, at the \n",

      "How do members obtain a 90-day supply of their maintenance medication? \n",
      "  If members do not currently have a prescription for a 90-day supply, they \n",
      "should contact their physician to determine whether a 90-day supply is \n",
      "appropriate for you. \n",
      "  If their physician believes that a 90-day supply is right for them, they can \n",
      "send IngenioRx home delivery an electronic prescription, fax the \n",
      "prescription to 800-378-0323, or call it in to the home delivery pharmacy at \n",

      "If a plan allows 90-day supplies, can members get a 90-day supply of any \n",
      "medication? \n",
      "No. We are unable to fill 90-day supplies of specialty medications and controlled \n",
      "substances such as opioids. In addition, to obtain a 90-day supply a member’s \n",
      "physician must approve and write a prescription specifically for a 90-day supply. \n",
      " \n",
      "Why can’t members get a 90-day supply of their specialty medication? \n",
      "  Specialty medications are particularly complex when it comes to dosing and \n",
      "potential side effects. As a result, individuals taking these medications \n",
      "require a higher degree of monitoring to ensure that the therapy is having \n",
      "the intended result and that it is well tolerated.  \n",
      "  Because of this, treatment approaches (dose, medication selected, \n",
      "duration, etc.) can change quickly. As a result, we limit specialty \n",
      "prescriptions to no more than 30-days.  \n",
      "  We continue to monitor for potential disruptions to the pharmacy supply \n",
      "chain and delivery logistics. At the present time, we have not identified any \n",
      "issues and feel confident that our specialty patients will continue to be able \n",
