      "What is coronavirus and what is COVID-19? \n",
      "There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly \n",
      "cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease caused by \n",
      "a new coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.   \n",
      " \n",
      "How do people become infected and how does it spread? \n",
      "Current understanding about how the virus that causes COVID-19 spreads is \n",
      "largely based on what is known about similar coronaviruses. COVID-19 is a new \n",
      "disease and there is more to learn about how it spreads, the severity of illness it \n",
      "causes, and to what extent it may spread in the United States.  \n",
      " \n",
      "What are the symptoms of COVID-19? \n",
      "People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of reported symptoms – ranging \n",
      "from mild symptoms to severe illness.  \n",
      " \n",
      "What if I am sick with COVID-19? \n",
      "If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever and \n",
      "symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your \n",
      "healthcare provider immediately. To help prevent the disease from spreading to \n",

      "leaving home using your smart phone, tablet or computer-enabled web cam. \n",
      " \n",
      "How can I help protect myself?  \n",
      "The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to the virus that \n",
      "causes COVID-19.  \n",
      "Avoid close contact \n",
      "  Avoid close contact with people who are sick \n",

      "take steps to support our members in their efforts to do so in a manner \n",
      "that is safe and effective. \n",
      "  We believe that this policy, particularly in light of the President’s \n",

While this EUA does not constitute an approval of this \\ndrug for the treatment of COVID-19, it does authorize the emergency use of \\nthe drug, as part of the current public health crisis, for the treatment of \\nCOVID-19 in patients meeting specific clinical criteria identified by the FDA. \\n\\uf0b7  Neither of these drugs have received FDA approval for the treatment of \\nCOVID-19 and many are still being investigated. \\n\\uf0b7  We are monitoring developments in this area closely and will evaluate \\ncoverage of any treatments once approved. \\n \\nThe FDA has issued an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA for remdesivir. \\nWhat does this mean? \\nBased on a review of topline data from two clinical trials investigating the use of \\nremdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19, on May 1, 2020, the Food & Drug \\nAdministration issued an EUA authorizing the emergency use of remdesivir for the \\nhospital-based treatment of COVID-19 in adults and children with a suspected or \\nconfirmed case of COVID-19 and severe disease that meets specific clinical \\ncriteria. \\n\\uf0b7  Remdesivir is an investigational anti-viral drug that is administered \\nintravenously and is not currently indicated for any condition. \\n\\uf0b7  The EUA does not constitute an approval of the drug, it’s use is authorized \\nonly on a temporary basis, and distribution of the drug will be coordinated \\nthrough the US government. \\n\\uf0b7  At the present time, Gilead has stated that remdesivir will be provided at \\nno cost through this EUA and, as a result, insurance will not be billed for its \\nuse. \\n7 | P a g e  \\n\\x0c \\nIs Empire covering COVID-19 treatment for in-network and out-of-network \\nproviders? \\nFrom April 1 through Dec. 31, Empire will waive member cost shares for \\ntreatment from in-network providers, for our fully-insured employer plans, \\nindividual plans, Individual Medicare Advantage plans, Group Retiree Solutions \\nplans and Medicaid plans, where permissible. For out-of-network providers, \\nEmpire is waiving cost shares from April 1 through May 31. \\n \\nIf a member is re-infected with COVID-19, does treatment fall under the covered \\nbenefit and are cost shares waived? \\nAt this time, scientists are not sure if people can become re-infected with COVID-\\n19. However, if a person does become re-infected, benefit coverage and cost \\nshare waivers for treatment would apply similar to how it does for any COVID-19 \\ninfection. Currently, cost shares have been waived for the treatment of COVID-19 \\nfrom April 1 through Dec. 31, 2020. Treatment cost share waivers may vary for \\nmembers who have self-insured plans, which have the ability to opt-in to member \\ncost share waivers during April 1 through May 31, 2020 and April 1 through \\nDecember 31, 2020. Out-of-network costs may also vary. \\n \\nUnder what conditions is diagnostic testing covered and cost shares waived?  \\nTests samples may be obtained in many settings including a doctor’s office, \\nurgent care, ER or even drive-thru testing.  Laboratory diagnostic tests for COVID-\\n19 at both in-network and out-of-network laboratories will be covered with no \\ncost sharing for members. \\n \\nWhile a test sample cannot be obtained through a telehealth visit at this time, a \\ntelehealth provider can help members get to a provider who can do so.   \\n \\nAre HMO members required to obtain an authorization/lab referral from their \\nPCP to obtain a COVID-19 related lab test? \\nNo. As stated in federal law, this coverage must be provided without cost sharing, \\nwhen medically appropriate for the individual, as determined by the individual’s \\nattending healthcare provider in accordance with accepted standards of current \\n8 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cmedical practice. This coverage must also be provided without imposing prior \\nauthorization or other medical management requirements. \\n \\nHow are diagnostic tests for COVID-19 reimbursed for contracted and non- \\ncontracted providers? \\nThe federal mandate applies to both fully-insured and self-insured plans and \\nrequires payment direct to the non- contracted providers at the published cash \\nprice or a negotiated rate that is less than the cash price. For contracted \\nproviders, plans must cover testing at the provider’s contracted rate. This applies \\nto both fully-insured and self-insured plans. \\n \\nShould serologic tests be used when trying to determine who should be allowed \\nback in the workplace? \\nCDC guidelines indicate that the tests should not be used to determine whether \\npeople with antibodies can return to work. \\n \\nWill Empire cover the cost of antibody/serology testing for COVID-19? \\nYes, in accordance with the Federal Mandate, Empire will waive cost sharing for \\ndiagnostic testing, including antibody testing, for COVID-19. This coverage \\nincludes tests administered in hospital or other medical facilities, freestanding \\nlaboratories or medical offices, pharmacies and drive-up testing sites.  \\nEmpire supports the need for accessible and timely diagnostic testing and contact \\ntracing to help manage the spread of COVID-19. Diagnostic testing – achieved \\nthrough viral tests to detect current infection – is conducted when an individual \\nhas symptoms of COVID-19 infection or has known exposure to an individual with \\nconfirmed COVID-19. Diagnostic testing can also be conducted on individuals \\nprioritized by departments of health for public health surveillance of COVID-19. \\nDiagnostic testing is generally conducted using molecular technology which \\ndetects the virus’s genetic material, but can also be conducted using antigen \\ntests, which detect protein fragments of the virus. Diagnostic testing plays an \\nimportant role in efforts to break the chain of transmission by identifying actively \\ninfected individuals. We encourage employers to follow CDC guidelines for the \\nuse of testing to confirm a current COVID-19 infection. \\n9 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cAntibody testing, also known as serology testing, identifies COVID-19 antibodies, \\nwhich indicate whether an individual has had a past COVID-19 infection. \\nDepending on when someone was infected and the timing of the test, the test \\nmay or may not also find antibodies in someone with a current COVID-19 \\ninfection. It is currently unknown whether the presence of antibodies indicates \\nthat someone is immune to COVID-19 infection or is unlikely to transmit the virus \\nthat causes COVID-19 — this is an active area of research. While a positive test for \\nantibodies can imply previous COVID-19 infection, the reliability of the test result \\nis limited except in populations for whom a previous infection is likely, such as \\nhealth care workers, individuals who have had a documented COVID-19 infection \\nconfirmed with viral testing, or those with suspected COVID-19 infection based on \\na history of symptoms that resulted from a likely exposure.  \\nEmpire is aligned with the CDC’s strategy to use antibody testing as a means of \\nunderstanding how much of the U.S. population has been previously infected, \\nhow infection rates vary by region, and how rates may be changing over time. \\nHowever, antibody testing is of limited value in helping to inform individual \\ndecision-making, including return-to-the-workplace strategies. Several groups, \\nincluding the American Medical Association, have advised limited use of antibody \\ntesting. The AMA issued guidance noting that these tests should be limited to use \\nin epidemiological/population-level studies and/or by physicians and \\nlaboratorians trained in the interpretation of serological tests and with a strong \\nunderstanding of the limitations of the results. The AMA does not recommend \\nindividuals pursue antibody testing to make personal decisions on physical \\ndistancing or to attempt to determine immunity to COVID-19. \\nGiven current uncertainty regarding what a positive antibody test results means, \\nantibody tests should not be used to inform return-to-the-workplace strategies. \\nReturn-to-the-workplace strategies should focus on reducing the risk of \\ntransmission through mitigating strategies such as use of enhanced hygiene and \\ncleaning protocols, implementing physical distance in the workplace, staggered \\nshifts, cloth facial covers, as well as closely monitoring the health of employees to \\nrapidly exclude sick individuals from the workplace.   \\nEmpire supports the need for accurate tests.  It is important to realize that in this \\ntime of crisis, not all of the FDA Emergency Use Authorized tests for COVID-19 \\nhave been carefully evaluated or shown to be accurate in an appropriately \\n10 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cdesigned clinical study. Recently, more labs have started to offer direct-to-\\nconsumer testing that can be purchased without a care provider ordering the test, \\nsuch as QuestDirect and others. If tests are purchased by a member directly from \\na lab and without a provider ordering and accurately billing for the test, these \\ncosts may be the consumer’s responsibility as articulated by those labs direct-to-\\nconsumer programs. \\n \\nDoes Empire cover COVID-19 home or self-administered diagnostic tests? Does \\nit waive cost shares for these tests?  \\nWe will cover home and self-administered COVID-19 diagnostic tests when the \\ntest meets the following coverage requirements: \\n\\uf0b7  the test or laboratory providing the test has authorization from the \\nappropriate government regulatory body, such as the Food and Drug \\nAdministration or a state laboratory authority; \\n\\uf0b7  the test is medically necessary and; \\n\\uf0b7  the test is ordered by a licensed practitioner.   \\n \\nEmpire will waive cost shares for home or self-administered COVID-19 tests when \\nthe test meets the coverage requirements.   \\n \\nIs Empire providing Medicare members with post-discharge support?  \\nEmpire will also provide post-discharge care to support Medicare members with \\ncomplex care needs who may need additional assistance as they transition back \\nto home following hospitalization. Empire’s care managers can help provide \\ncoordination of medications and home health needs, scheduling follow up \\nappointments and transportation. \\n \\nAre cost shares waived for all providers who offer telehealth? \\nCost sharing will be waived for members using <<CompanyName>’s telehealth \\nservice, LiveHealth Online, as well as care received from other in-network \\nproviders delivering virtual care from March 17 through Sept. 13, 2020 or any \\nlonger period required by state law. Co-pays for physical and behavioral \\ntelehealth visits for health conditions will be waived. For out-of-network \\n11 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cproviders, <<CompanyName> is waiving cost shares through March 17 through \\nJune 14, 2020. \\n \\nHow is Empire covering telemedicine? \\nTelemedicine (video + audio via app): Starting March 17, 2020, Empire began \\nwaiving member cost sharing for telemedicine (video + audio) visits including \\ncovered visits for mental health and substance use disorders, for our fully insured \\nemployer plans, Individual plans, Medicare plans and Medicaid plans, where \\npermissible.  This applies to use of our LiveHealth Online platform, as well as for \\ncare received from other providers delivering virtual care through internet video \\nand audio services. Self-insured plan sponsors may opt out of this program.  \\n \\nThis will remain in place for 90 days or as long as the emergency New York rule is \\nin effect. Members can call the number on the back of their identification card to \\nconfirm coverage. Providers should continue to verify eligibility and benefits for \\nall members prior to rendering services.  \\n \\nTelehealth visits (phone with video capability):  Starting March 19, 2020, Empire \\nbegan waiving member cost sharing for telehealth visits with in-network and out-\\nof-network providers acting within the scope of their license. This includes \\ncovered visits for behavioral health and substance use disorders and medical \\nservices, where medically appropriate if other requirements for a covered health \\nservice are met.  This applies to fully-insured employer plans, individual plans, \\nMedicare and Medicaid plans, where permissible. Self-insured plan sponsors may \\nopt out of this program. Phone/video delivery must be HIPAA compliant. This will \\nremain in place for 90 days or as long as the emergency NY rule is in effect. \\nNote: Telehealth does not include the use of facsimile, telephone-only, or email. \\n \\nTelephonic-only care \\nFor 90 days effective March 19, 2020, Empire will cover telephonic-only visits with \\nin-network providers. Out-of-network coverage will be provided where required.  \\n\\uf0b7  This includes visits for behavioral health, for our fully insured employer \\nplans, individual plans, Medicare plans and Medicaid plans, where \\npermissible.  \\n12 | P a g e  \\n\\x0c\\uf0b7  Cost shares will be waived for in-network providers only. Self-insured plan \\nsponsors may opt out of this program.  \\n\\uf0b7  Exceptions include chiropractic services, physical, occupational, and speech \\ntherapies. These services are not appropriate for telephone-only \\nconsultations. Self-insured plan sponsors may opt out of this program. \\nPhone delivery must be HIPAA compliant. \\n \\nIf I am incorrectly charged for LiveHealth Online visits, will I be reimbursed? \\nMembers who may have been incorrectly charged for their telehealth visit via \\nLiveHealth Online will receive a refund back to the credit card used at the time of \\nvisit.  \\n \\nDo the waivers apply to out-of-network providers for testing and office visits \\nrelated to testing? \\nIf an in-network provider is not available, Empire will work with members to find \\nan out-of-network provider and then the waivers would apply. \\n \\nWill cost shares associated with testing and related services be waived for \\nmembers enrolled in high-deductible health plans with HSAs? \\nCost shares associated with testing and related services may be waived for \\nmembers enrolled in high-deductible health plans, or HDHP with HSAs. Based on \\nIRS guidance, such cost share waivers will not jeopardize the status of the plan as \\nan HDHP. In addition, benefits can be provided for treatment before having to \\nmeet the HDHP deductible. \\n \\nIf a member is treated for COVID-19 outside the United States, will coverage \\napply and will out-of-pocket waivers apply? \\nYes, a member’s regular coverage would apply for testing and treatment of \\nCOVID-19, just like it does in the United States. Member cost shares for the \\nfocused test used to diagnose COVID-19 and the visit related to the test will be \\nwaived for members—specifically, individual, Medicare and Medicaid members, \\nas well as members in self-insured and other fully-insured plans.  \\n \\nIf a member needs to be quarantined, does Empire cover that?  \\n13 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cEmpire health plans will cover reasonable health care costs for members related \\nto COVID-19. Members will pay any cost shares their plan requires, unless \\notherwise determined by state law or regulation. \\n \\nHow can you ensure that your contracted providers can still provide services \\nduring the pandemic? \\nEmpire is committed to working with and supporting its contracted providers. Our \\nbenefits already state that if members do not have appropriate access to network \\ndoctors that we will authorize coverage for out-of-network doctors as medically \\nnecessary. \\n \\nIn addition, Empire’s telehealth provider, LiveHealth Online, is another safe and \\neffective way for members to see a doctor to receive health guidance related to \\nCOVID-19 from their home via mobile device or a computer with a webcam.   \\n \\nAre you aware of any limitations in coverage for treatment of an \\nillness/virus/disease that is part of an epidemic? \\nOur standard contracts do not have exclusions or limitations on coverage for \\nservices for the treatment of illnesses that result from an epidemic. \\n \\nA member received a notice that a claim will be denied if the member does not \\nsubmit additional information within a certain timeframe. Is this correct?  \\nThe timeframe is correct, but Anthem will disregard days that occur during the \\nNational Emergency or Outbreak Period. Anthem will count days against the \\ntimeframe provided under the notice once the National Emergency or Outbreak \\nPeriod ends. If the notice includes a due date, this due date can be used to \\ndetermine how much additional time is available once the National Emergency or \\nOutbreak Period ends.  \\n \\nWhat is the outbreak period? \\nPlease note, the “Outbreak Period” is a definition that provides additional relief \\nfor a particular location beyond that which is generally applicable under the \\ndeclaration of the National Emergency.  \\nThe “Outbreak Period” is defined as the period beginning March 1, 2020 and \\nending 60 days after the date on which the federal government declares the \\n14 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cCOVID-19 national emergency has ended with respect to a particular location \\n(which has yet to be determined) and may be announced by the Department of \\nLabor and Treasury in a future notice. The Outbreak Period may not be longer \\nthan one year.   \\nAs an Outbreak Period has not been announced for any particular location. \\nAnthem recommends that employers monitor updates by visiting the Department \\nof Labor’s website.  \\n \\nHow is Anthem addressing Federal Guidance that pushes back due dates for \\nenrollment, claims, grievances and appeals, and independent external review? \\nUnder the guidance, ERISA group health and disability plans must push back \\ncertain due dates effective March 1 until 60 days after the end of the declaration \\nof the National Emergency or “Outbreak Period,” whichever is later.  \\nThe following due dates are suspended:  \\n\\uf0b7  The 30-day period (or 60-day period, if applicable) to request special \\nenrollment  \\n\\uf0b7  The 60-day election period for COBRA continuation coverage \\n\\uf0b7  The date for making COBRA premium payments \\n\\uf0b7  The date for individuals to notify the plan of a qualifying event or \\ndetermination of disability  \\n\\uf0b7  The date within which individuals may file a benefit claim under the plan’s \\nclaims procedure  \\n\\uf0b7  The date within which claimants may file an appeal of an adverse benefit \\ndetermination under the plan’s claims procedure  \\n\\uf0b7  The date within which claimants may file a request for an external review \\nafter receipt of an adverse benefit determination or final internal adverse \\nbenefit determination  \\n\\uf0b7  The date within which a claimant may file information to perfect a request \\nfor external review upon a finding that the request was not complete. \\nAnthem will enroll participants and suspend timeframes for claims and appeals in \\na manner consistent with the guidance for group health and disability plans \\neffective March 1, 2020. Anthem will forward independent external reviews \\nrequests consistent with plan timeframes.  \\n \\n15 | P a g e  \\n\\x0cA member received a notice that COBRA coverage will be cancelled if payment \\nis not made within a certain timeframe. Is this correct?  \\nThe timeframe is correct, but Anthem will disregard days that occur during the \\nNational Emergency or Outbreak Period. Anthem will count days against the \\ntimeframe provided under the notice once the National Emergency or Outbreak \\nPeriod ends. If the notice includes a due date, this due date can be used to \\ndetermine how much additional time is available once the National Emergency or \\nOutbreak Period ends.  \\n \\nHow much additional time will members have to submit eligibility, COBRA \\npayment, or claims information?  \\nIt depends. Timeframes are suspended until 60 days after the end of the National \\nEmergency or Outbreak Period. After this 60-day period, Anthem will start \\ncounting days against timeframes. Because each situation may be different, \\nAnthem recommends submitting information as soon as possible. Please see \\nspecific examples under Federal Guidance for more information.  \\n \\nIf claims are rejected because a member’s eligibility or payment information is \\nnot current, can claims be reprocessed if updated eligibility or payment \\ninformation is provided? \\nYes. Anthem can reprocess claims if updated payment or eligibility information is \\nprovided. If claims need to be reprocessed based upon updated eligibility and/or \\npayment information, members should contact Anthem using the number on \\ntheir ID card.  \\n \\nWill Anthem provide notice that the National Emergency or Outbreak Period \\nhas ended?  \\nAnthem will cascade notice to group health disability plans that the National \\nEmergency or Outbreak Period has ended. However, we recommend monitoring \\nthe Department of Labor’s website for additional updates.  \\n \\nTelehealth, Telemedicine, Sydney Care and 24/7 NurseLine \\nTelehealth and Telemedicine \\n16 | P a g e  \\n\\x0c \\nIs Empire encouraging broader use of telehealth and telemedicine? \\nWe are recommending members use telehealth or telemedicine when they can as \\nit reduces the burden on the healthcare system, prevents members from \\nspreading a virus and can help protect them from getting a virus while waiting \\nwith others at a physical facility.  \\n \\nWe also encouraging members access our Sydney Care app at no cost. The app \\nincludes a Coronavirus Assessment, available soon, that can help members quickly \\nand safely evaluate their symptoms and assess their risk and then communicate \\nwith a doctor to address additional questions. Members can download the \\nSydney Care app on Android or iOs. \\n \\nWhy is telehealth and telemedicine a good option to receive individual health \\nguidance related to COVID-19? \\nWe are recommending members use telemedicine and telehealth when they can \\nas it prevents them from spreading a virus to others in a waiting room or clinic \\nand can help protect them from getting a virus while waiting with others at a \\nphysical facility. \\n \\nLiveHealth Online is a safe and helpful way use Empire benefits to see a doctor to \\nreceive health guidance related to COVID-19 without leaving home, using your \\nsmart phone, tablet or computer-enabled web cam.   \\n \\nWhile COVID-19 can’t be confirmed through virtual or remote care, care teams \\ncan screen members, assign risk, answer questions and recommend the next \\nsteps a member should take.
